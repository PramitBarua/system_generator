system_description: this system contain one (16,0) zigzag tube and one graphene sheet of 9 unit block.


General Desccription:
   This file contains the input parameters to generate the system.
   The system consists of a tube on top of the graphene sheets.
   The graphene sheet will be always in the 'X-Z' plane.  
   The tube will be always zizgaz and the tube axis is 'Z'. The tube will be in the middle of the graphene. 
   However, the overlap distance (Z direction) as well as the gap between graphene and tube (Y direction) can vary.
   As input parameter user will provide the xyz file that contains the coordinates of one unit cell of the tube.
   The program checks the diameter of the tube. If the ('num_unit_X'*sqrt(3)*1.42) is less than (tube_diameter + 10A*)
   then program will raise an error.
   
Input Parameter Description:
   graphene:
      num_unit_X: number of unit cell in the X direction (number of rows)
      num_unit_Z: number of unit cell in the Z direction (number of columns)
   tube:
      tube_dir: address of the directory that contians xyz file
      tube_name: name of the xyz file
      tube_num_unit: number of unit cell of the tube in the quantum system (this input defines the number of unit cell of tube without overlap with graphene)
   common:
      left_graphene_tube_overlap: number of unit cell that graphene and tube overlap      
      graphene_tube_distance: gap between graphene and tube   
      system_file_name: name of the coordinate file (with .xyz suffix)
      map_file_name: name of the map file (with .txt suffix)
